# KRPC5

[KRPC5](https://jaxa.krpc.jp/) is an educational program in which students solve various problems by programming free-flying robots (Astrobee and Int-Ball) in the International Space Station (ISS).

## Ideas

1. [Move](https://github.com/Captainistz/KRPC5-B4c0nL0v3r/blob/main/app/src/main/java/jp/jaxa/iss/kibo/rpc/sampleapk/Guide.java) efficiently.
2. [Recognize items](https://github.com/Captainistz/KRPC5-B4c0nL0v3r/blob/main/app/src/main/java/jp/jaxa/iss/kibo/rpc/sampleapk/ObjectDetection.java) using YOLOv8 from [Items Recognition](https://github.com/Captainistz/Items-Recognition).
3. Error and Randomness handling. (Which is none. ðŸ¤”)

You can see a full explaination at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/p_WsmgyFoDk?si=kfUS8ko6dsxaePzH). (In ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­)

_ps. Do whatever you want with these code._
